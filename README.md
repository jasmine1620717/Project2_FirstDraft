# Project2_FirstDraft
First draft of Project 2. My scientific question is When looking at the VEGFR2 structure, will adding the key structural components of Type II Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), specifically sorafenib, a H bond donor and polarized C-H interactions with flanking backbone carbonyls, increase the drug potency? My scientific hypothesis is If an H bond donor and polarized C-H interactions with flanking backbone carbonyls are added, similar to sorafenib, then the drug potency will increase because of this Type II TKI structure being sterically big and having the JM domain constantly in itâ€™s out conformation, which will be seen in cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics.
Need files to run code (FAFSA, microarray, etc)
1) Jupyter notebook
2) SDF file used

Information about SDF file was found:
     The structure of Imanitinib can be obtained from ChemBL https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/g/#search_results/all/query=imantinib. To find this file I brought up the website ChemBL. After, I search imantinib and downloaded the SDF file by pressing the icon on the righ hand side.
     The output of the code should represent ligand based docking.
